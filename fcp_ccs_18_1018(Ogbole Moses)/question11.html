  OGBOLE'S College of Arts and Science (OCAS) was started in the year 2005 with the intent to provide quality education at the undergraduate level and post-graduate level, focusing primarily on meeting the talent requirements of the domestic and global IT and IT-enabled service providers.
       The infrastructure available in the institution for the pursuit of IT and ITES education is unparalleled. A very liberal scholarship provides for opportunities for economically challenged yet academically brilliant students to take up courses at the college.
        Choosing the right institution for the future will depend on the proximity of such institutions with the industry. KG College of Arts and Science, an Institution sponsored by KG Information Systems Private Limited, is the perfect match to an Industry-Institute learning environment. We call it 'Campus Inside' where learning takes place within the precinct of Industry.
        The KG College of Arts and Science is located on the KG Campus, a sprawling 40-acre campus, just 8 kms from city, which also houses the BPO, Software, Call Center operations of KGiSL apart from co-location of its institute of higher learning. The Campus presents the perfect integration of Institute - Industry - Infrastructure in an environment of perfecting learning - the foothills of the Western Ghats, Coimbatore.
       The placement opportunities start from the time you join such future-thinking programmes. What better then, will be an opportunity, than mentoring yourself at an institution sponsored by an Industry.

      "Knowledge is power and library is the powerhouse". Books are the best teachers and counselors. To synchronize theory and practice, the journals, magazines and newspapers are very helpful. A Library is a collection of information, resources and services, organized for use, and maintained by a responsible body. Libraries inform the public of what materials are available in their collections and how to access that information. A modern Library provides educational resources to students and teachers through publications and other electronic media.

The library is spanned in a 3000 sqft building with air-conditioning facility and it can accommodate 350 students for reading.

The library is computerized and is well equipped with more than 7000 volumes of books various disciplines, 55 magazines and periodicals. The college has invested more than Rs 35 lakhs for the library in the last 4 years for the purchase of the books.

The college spends a minimum of Rs 5 lakhs each year on the books and Rs 2 lakhs for subscribing the journals and periodicals.

      Hostels for students reflect corporate fitness in design and functionality, with separate infrastructure for men and women. The campus hostels are again an opportunity for cross integration of student learning with corporate life where the student is able to share knowledge and learn from his mentors the workplace competencies. We have separate hostels for men and women viz. KGiSL-Boys Hostel & KGiSL-Girls Hostel.
